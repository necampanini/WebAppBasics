Learned a lot about implementing hashing for passwords. Probably just the barebone
basics, but lot of fun. More importantly, I created an orphan branch (no history)
off original master to obscure any possibility of having sensitive information 
being pushed up.

Rider IDE was able to handle all the assembly swapping and hard git resets 
to accomplish this. The only hiccup was having several assembly references
not be correctly referenced. Workaround: remove a broken assembly via 
Rider's NuGet manager, and re-add it. Clean/build and solution was okie dokie.

Just wanted to get these thoughts down while it's fresh.
